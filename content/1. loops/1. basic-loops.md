## Key points

A loop allows blocks of code to be repeated, without the need to copy paste.

In javascript,
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1) {
  console.log(i)
}
```
will log the numbers from `1` to `10` in the console.

## Todo

Open the terminal in the editor to the left. Make sure you `cd activate` to go into the activate folder, and then run `npm install` to get the necessary files installed. You only need to do this once.
